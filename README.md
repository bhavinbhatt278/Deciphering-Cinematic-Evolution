# Deciphering-Cinematic-Evolution
A brief analysis of 30 years of Cinematic Excellence.

**Objective**
The Objective of the proposed research is to do a comprehensive analysis of the movie data for the last 30years using various data indicators such as the year of release, Director , Writer, country of origin, gross revenue, company and runtime of a movie. Our goal is to provide insights from analysis of the datasets.
We will visualise the data across various categories such as which movie earned the most grossed revenue across regions. We will also analyse which Director and writer combination was most successful. Then we will analyse which production houses had the most success ratio.
By analysing and visualising the data points we will come up with a recommendation for Steven Spielberg to help him with an informed decision making of producing a movie for the Summer. The recommendation would include the genre, writer, director and various other factors to ease out his decision making process with the help of data analysis
